    o fixed a major bug which was leaving the db handle screwed up after
      the fork in daemonize... moved daemonize to earlier place in code
      and also check dbh more often with ping, cleanup, and reconnect if
      necessary.  This forced me to add lots of checking, for valid $sth
      statement handles, to add $sth->finish calls, and sprinkled 
      debugMessage calls throughout the code.
    o fixed bug when no karma.conf file found, and karma uses DBI_USER,
      DBI_PASS, DBI_DSN...
