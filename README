NAME
    Karma - Readme

DESCRIPTION
    To get started with karma, first edit a config file. For starters, use
    the basic.conf file. Edit it for the databases you'd like to connect to.

    Next set the $KARMA_HOME environment variable. This specifies where
    karma will look for the karma.conf file (otherwise it will look in the
    current directory). Also, karma will store the .karma.pid, and
    .karmafifo files here.

    Next start karmad running. You can use the -h option for help, or just
    start it like this:

    `$ bin/karmactl -s -c karma.conf'
GENERAL INSTRUCTIONS
    See the quickstart document for more information about getting started.
    See the config guide for information on configuration of karma in
    general, and the karma.conf file in particular. See the install guide
    for more info on installation.
