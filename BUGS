NAME
    Karma - Bug List

DESCRIPTION
    Common document to organize all outstanding bugs, and associated
    version numbers.

Version 0.9.3
    o problems on Win32
    o db down doesn't always respect unmonitored services
Version 1.0.0
    o Platform: Linux
    o Oracle Version: 8.0.5.1.0
    o Description: Shutdown a database while Karmad is running and it
      segfaults.
    o Solution: Rebuild DBD::Oracle with
        `$ perl Makefile.PL -8'

        and rerun karmad. This builds DBD::Oracle with the OCI 7
        API, which doesn't seem to exhibit this bug.<br>
