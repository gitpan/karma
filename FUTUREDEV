NAME
    Karma - Future Development

DESCRIPTION
    There are already plans to expand on the functionality present
    in Karma. Here's a list of some of the things I'm working on for
    a future release.

Details
    o lynx browser support (no frames, no tables?)
    o configuration check tool (reads karma.conf file)
    o web interface
    o help page for adding new services
    - using karmactl
    - editing karma.conf
    o more services monitored
    - hitratios dictcache, rowcache
    - listener log monitor
    - trace/core file monitor
    - monitor sqlnet performance
    - archive dest directory
    - backup success
    o karma.conf
    - specify frames/no frames/no tables support
    - specify no html pages generated, text only
    - vertical/horizontal arrangement option
    o whom to contact messages
    o look at adding graphing support http://www.munitions.com/~jra/cricket/
    o resetting services, once you've seen them, turn back to green
      (not sure if this fits into the non-CGI thinking so far...)
