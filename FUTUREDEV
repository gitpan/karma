NAME
    Karma - Future Development

DESCRIPTION
    There are already plans to expand on the functionality present in Karma.
    Here's a list of some of the things I'm working on for a future release.

Details
    o lynx browser support (no frames, no tables?)
    o configuration check tool (reads karma.conf file)
    o web interface
    o help page for adding new services
    o more services monitored
        - hitratios dictcache, rowcache
        - listener log monitor
        - trace/core file monitor
        - monitor sqlnet performance
        - archive dest directory
        - backup success
        - buffer busy waits
        - locks
    o karma.conf
        - specify frames/no frames/no tables support
        - specify no html pages generated, text only
        - vertical/horizontal arrangement option
    o whom to contact messages
    o look at adding graphing support http://www.munitions.com/~jra/cricket/
    o resetting services, once you've seen them, turn back to green (not
    sure if this fits into the non-CGI thinking so far...)
    o 7.x issues
        - no autoextend column
        - first_time column in v$log is varchar2 (date in 8.x
        o info pages include warning, alert values
    o remaining Win32 problems, check email notification
        - signal handling
        - named pipe
    o notify full includes url to info page this will require a new line in
    the config file like SERVER:http://www.something.com/karma onto which
    the rest can be appended
    o simplifying code by using views in "karma" schema (tremendous code
    simplification, maintenance easier, adding services easier, hides 7.x,
    8.x issues)
    o Duncan's redolog monitoring ideas
    o reorganize code (OOP)
    o mySQL, other db modules
    o past 1 or 2 days worth of log data (with link and info page)
    o log statuses over time, use cricket for graphing
    o table only data which we can include in another html page
    o karmagentd should have trimming functionality for when alert or os
    stats tables get too big
    o is the os stats interval configurable?
    o weekly reports via email
    o karmactl -u for "UP" or not (returns 0/1) useful for other monitoring
    systems
