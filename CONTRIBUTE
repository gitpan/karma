NAME
    Karma - Contribute

DESCRIPTION
    Presently Karma is just a one man show. I'm doing development in between
    various other work. Right now what I need most is feedback, though I'm
    interested also in hearing other ideas for additions. Any comments you
    have can be sent to

    Some questions I have are:

    o What do you think of karma?
    o Do you find it useful?
    o Might you use it to monitor production databases when it's been
    further tested?
    o Have you found any bugs?
    o Do you find any Oracle monitoring to be incorrect or misleading?
