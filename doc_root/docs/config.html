If you're concerned aboutKarma making changes in your database, create a read-only userfor it to login as.  The supplied script $KARMA/sql/karma_user.sqlwill do just that.  Examine the script, then login as sys, andrun it like this (we're assuming here that you've cd'd into the"sql" directory:<UL><i>SQL> @karma_user.sql     <br>Enter value for karma_password: amrak <br><br>User created. <br><br><br>Grant succeeded.<br><br><br>Grant succeeded.<br></i></UL><p>You can now use this user and the password you specified when<A HREF="config.html#conf">configuring the karma.conf file</A>.</font><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="5"><A NAME="conf">Editing the karma.conf file</A></font><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">The karma.conf file is the core configuration file for karma.  Eventually be updatable via a web front-end.<p>The format of most lines in this file is:<p><i>SERVICE:X:Y:Z</i><p>The SERVICE can be one of these:<p><UL>redologsrollbacktablespacesslow_sqlalert_loghit_ratios fragmentationextentslatchmts</UL><p>X  - how often (in minutes) to monitor this info<br>Y  - warning threshold<br>Z  - alert threshold<br><p>A service is not monitored if it's time column is 0, or it is commented out with the # character, or if it is not in thefile at all.  For repeated entries, the last one listed willbe used.<p>The "karma" line in this file follows a special convention.It looks like this:<p><i>karma:name:user:pass:X<br></i><p>where "name" is listed as a service in the tnsnames.ora file."user" is the user to login to the database as, and "pass"is the password to use.  X is how often the karma.pl scriptshould wake up to check your database.  You should have*many* of these lines, one for each database you wish tomonitor.  Conversely you can specify:<p><i>karma:ALL:user:pass:X</i><p>meaning every entry in the tnsnames.ora file.  I'm not sureif this will be much use though, as they'll all have to havethe same username and password.  If you have a service named "ALL", sorry.  :-)<p>In addition to the "karma" line, the "refresh" directive isspecial as well.  It looks like this:<p><i>refresh:X</i><p>X is how often the generated html page should refresh.It's probably a good idea for this value to be less thanthe refresh karma does for that database.<p>Here's an example karma.conf file.

This is asomewhat labor intensive task that the dba must perform regularlyand my goal here is to simplify this task.<p>If you're going to monitor the alertlog you must create the KARMA_ALERTLOG_ERRORS table, and if you are going to monitorOS stats, you must create the KARMA_OS_STATS table.  For monitoringeither, you must startup the karmagentd daemon.<p>Login as the karma user <a href=config.html#user">created above</a>and do the following:<p><i>SQL> @karma_objs    <br>Creating karma_os_stats table...<br><br>Table created.<br><br>Creating karma_alertlog_errors table...<br><br>Table created.<br><br></i><p>Monitoring is achieved via the karmagentd daemon.  This daemonmust be run on *each* target database.  This is necessary becausethe alertlog is an OS logfile, which is only accessible locallyon the machine.  Karmagentd reads the alertlog and keeps trackof it's file position, periodically waking up to check for changes.In addition, it will run "uptime" on that machine as well.  Whenif finds any ORA-xxx errors in the alert log, it writes them toKARMA_ALERTLOG_ERRORS, and KARMA_OS_STATS respectively.<p>For more help with the karmagentd daemon, use the -h option:<p><i>$ ./karmagentd -h<br><br> h - print this help info<br> f - fequency in minutes to wakeup & check things (default 1)<br> r - reset the alert.log, and truncate it's table<br> u - user to login as (default karma)<br> p - oracle login password (otherwise you're prompted)<br> j - jump j bytes in file (takes precedence over save file)<br> t - tnsname of the database to watch (default local)<br> a - specify alert.log file (default OFA)<br> k - use this file to store seek position<br> b - specify ORACLE_BASE (takes precedence over env)<br> h - specify ORACLE_HOME (takes precedence over env)<br> s - specify ORACLE_SID (takes precedence over env<br> d - debug level (default 0, no debugging)<br><br>./karmagentd [-h] [-f #] [-r] [-u karma] [-p pass] [-j #] [-t DB]<br>	[-a alert.log] [-k karmagent.sav] [-b ORACLE_BASE]<br>	[-h ORACLE_HOME] [-s ORACLE_SID] [-d #]<br><br></i><p></font><p>    </td>  </tr></table></body></html>
