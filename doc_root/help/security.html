Karma has been designed with security in mind, from both the OS perspective
and the database perspective. If you find any security related problems or
bugs, please be sure to email them to me.

I've created associated scripts in the ``sql'' directory to provide a way
to easily create a user for running karma. Notice that the user is created
with ``SELECT ANY TABLE'' privilages. This will prevent karma from being
able to modify anything in your database. Though it does not make any such
attempt, this provides peace of mind.

Karma does not run as a cgi script, and things are done that way for a
number of reasons. For one, it protects the database from many iterations
of a cgi script which could potentially impact performance. For another it
virtually eliminates cgi-bin related security issues. The html pages which
are ultimately loaded into a browser are prebuilt, and static for each
iteration until karma wakes up again, and refreshes them.
