Karma - Win32 Specific Instructions

<P>
From the reports I've received, karma does indeed run under various Windows
platforms. Unfortunately, up to this point, I have not had a windows box on
which to do development, so there are some limitations. In particular,
karmactl does not work well, as it relies on the unix <CODE>fork()</CODE>
facility, as well as named pipes for status information, and process
signals such as INT, KILL, HUP, USR1, and USR2. In addition, I have not
heard reports pro or con about karmagentd, so if you find it works, email
me with more info, so I can add it to this document.

I've made sufficient modifications to karmad so that it checks to see if
it's running on a win32 platform. If it is, it will *NOT* try to fork. To
start it do the following:

<P>
<CODE>perl karmad -c karma.conf</CODE>



<P>
To get help do this:

<P>
<CODE>perl karmad -h</CODE>



<P>
I need feedback to make it work better. If you find something could be done
better, by all means email me. If you wanna send a patch to fix something,
EVEN BETTER.

I'd like to have karma running with all it's features and tested for solid
stability. I'd in addition like it to run in a native way, for instance as
a service, the Win32 equivalent of a unix background process.  

<P>
However, I'm no Win32 expert. If you like doing Perl development on Win32,
and are interested in Karma, let me know. Perhaps you can help with the
port and testing.
