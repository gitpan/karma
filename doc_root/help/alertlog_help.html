The Oracle alert.log facility is similar to that of the unix syslog
facility.  It is used to report various system messages like startup
and shutdown, as well as checkpoints, redo-log switches, and most 
importantly ORA-xxxx errors.

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font size="3">

Monitoring ORA-xxxx errors is an important part of the DBA's
responsibility, and Karma aims to ease that burden by watching
the alert.log for you.

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font size="3">

Karma monitors databases remotely, and as such cannot directly
access an OS level file such as the alert.log.   The solution
(if you're interested in monitoring the alert.log of remote
databases) is the run an additional script which comes with Karma
on any machine whose alert.log you wish to monitor.  Essentially
it watches the file for changes, and writes any ORA-xxxx errors
to a table.  Karma then just watches this table for new entries.
Checkout the karmagentd for more information on configuring that
end of things.

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font size="3">

Beyond that, configure alertlog monitoring like you would any
other facility in Karma.  Here's an example:

</font></font></font><i><font color="#009900"></font></i>
<p><i><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font color="#330033"><font size=+1>
alertlog:X:Y:Z
</font></font></font></i><font color="#330033"></font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font size="3">


Where X is the number of minutes between checks of the alert.log
monitoring table.  Y is the number of minutes within which to
consider the error and WARNING level situation.  Z is the number
of minutes within which to consider the error a WARNING level
situation.  Here's a recommended configuration:

<p><i><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font color="#330033"><font size=+1>

alertlog:15:86400:60

</i></font></font></font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font size="3">

This tells karma to monitor every 15 minutes, consider any ORA-xxxx
errors within a day to be a WARNING situation, and any ORA-xxxx
errors in the last hour to be an ALERT situation.
