Karma - How to Monitor Multiple Oracle Databases

<P>
An Oracle DBA has many responsibilities and day-to-day tasks to complete.
Karma was developed with the idea that many of these tasks can be
automated, thus freeing time for other useful work. This presentation will
discuss setup and configuration of Karma to provide you with a simple
web-interface for monitoring an unlimited number of Oracle databases. 

<P>
<HR>
<H1><A NAME="Introduction">Introduction</A></H1>
<P>
In the course of being an Oracle DBA, one is confronted with many varied
tasks. Some of them are mundane and repetitive, while others require
thinking, and debugging. Karma was developed with the idea of eliminating
many of the day-to-day mundane and repetitive tasks so a DBA can be left to
spend time more wisely.

<P>
You'll find Karma is quite useful especially when you need to keep a
watchful eye on many databases, as it can monitor a lot of important Oracle
vital signs like latch contention, hit ratios, tablespace quotas, max
extents, redo log switching, rollback segment contention, fragmentation,
slow sql queries, alert log errors, and replication's deferred transaction,
and error queues. In addition, Karma can be configured to send email on
warning or alert conditions, even notifying you by alphanumeric pager if
necessary. In short, Karma can help you be more proactive with respect to
the databases you manage.

<P>

<H1><A NAME="What_it_does_and_how">What it does and how</A></H1>
<P>
Karma is a web-based application, however, it has some very important
differences from a normal CGI based application. First a little bit of
background.

<P>
With a CGI, generally, requesting a given url is actually a request to
apache to run a certain program. In the case of a database application, it
would connect to the database, perform some function, disconnect, and
return an HTML page based on the results of the database requests. This is
how dynamic web content is created on the web. A lot of improvement over
this has occured since it's beginnings, like mod_perl, an apache module
which caches your code, as well as the database connections, making them
persistent. All in all, these changes provided dramatic improvement over
earlier non-cached solutions, but still present some problems for a
database monitor.

<P>
In the case of Karma, this traditional scheme posed some problems. Besides
the fact that CGI applications, if not written very cleanly, can pose some
security risk, they also constitute a hit each time they are called. If
many users wanted to keep an eye on the databases monitored each time they
loaded the karma main page, they would be hitting the database. What's more
there'd be no way to provide email notification in such a scheme. There'd
be no program running until the user initiated in from the browser.  

<P>
For these reasons I decided NOT to make this application a simple CGI.
Instead, I built it as a unix daemon. It is started once, and kept running
in the background until explicitely told to quit. While running, it wakes
up periodically, checks up on the database, generates the relevant HTML
pages, and if necessary, sends out email notification of any warning or
alert conditions. That's it, it then happily goes back to sleep.

<P>
The HTML pages that are generated are static, so no matter how often you
load them in your browser, you DO NOT hit the database at all. It's like
magic! The real beauty is in the refresh tag. The main HTML page includes a
tag which tells the browser to every so often reload the page. This is set
to match the wakeup time of Karma, so when a new page is generated, the
browser will just make a new request.

Honestly, it's not all bad. First you'll need Oracle installed of course.
Not for the database you'll be monitoring, but you'll need to install the
client software to get the Perl DBD-Oracle module to work. In fact, you'll
need a bit more than just the client software as DBD-Oracle is a compile C
program, using the OCI Oracle library to access the database. Include the
Pro*C, and database itself when you install to be sure you get everything
DBD-Oracle needs to compile. You can delete much of it later.

<P>
To install a Perl module, you need only (1) uncompress and untar, (2)
generate the makefile, (3) make test, and finally (4) install.

<P>
<CODE>$ gunzip &lt; DBI-1.03.tar.gz | tar xvf -</CODE>



<P>
<CODE>$ cd DBI-1.03</CODE>



<P>
<CODE>$ perl Makefile.PL</CODE>



<P>
<CODE>$ make test</CODE>



<P>
then as root:

<P>
<CODE>$ make install</CODE>



<P>
You'll follow the same steps to install DBD-Oracle.  

<P>
After that, you'll be ready to do the same for Karma. It's got a standard
perl installer, with a Makefile.PL so you can follow the same steps above
to install.

<P>

<H1><A NAME="Configuration_and_Setup">Configuration and Setup</A></H1>
<P>
Get started quickly by editing the basic.conf file. The following gives a
rough example. The first line simply specifies the database to connect to.
Use one for each database you'd like to monitor. The fields are:

<P>
&lt;1&gt;:&lt;2&gt;:&lt;3&gt;:&lt;4&gt;:&lt;5&gt;

<P>
1 - 'karma' a reserved word meaning this is a db spec line

<P>
2 - pref group, can be *, 'default', blank, or any string

<P>
3 - db, from your tnsnames.ora file

<P>
4 - username

<P>
5 - password

<P>
Below that you'll find the services you'd like to monitor. These are
reserved words, and although case is not important they must be spelled
correctly, or they'll be ignored.

<P>
Other features can be enabled such as non-blinking icons, email
notification, or preference groups (different monitoring for each group).
See other *.conf files for details.

<P>
Finally you'll want to start the daemon:

<P>
<CODE>$ karmactl -s -c myfile.conf</CODE>



<P>
If your config file is karma.conf, and is in the current directory, then
you don't have to specify it with <CODE>-c</CODE>. Use <CODE>-h</CODE> for help.

<P>
Karma should run on any unix platform which Oracle provides client libs and
OCI for. I've confirmed it's working on Linux, Sun Solaris, and DG-UX. As
far as NT and other Win32 platforms are concerned, it is working, but with
some issues. Essentially, the unix fork () system call is not supported
under Win32, as well as various signals. These are all used by karmactl,
the assistant utility which can start and stop the daemon. For that reason,
for now karma only works by calling the daemon directly on Win32 platforms.
Something like this should work:

<P>
<CODE>$ perl karmad -d 2 -c c:\mydir\karma.conf -k c:\mydir\doc_root</CODE>



<P>
Note that <CODE>-d</CODE> option. This turns debugging on, and cannot be used from the karmactl
utility. You may find it useful.

I have a LOT of great ideas for what I want to do with Karma, but have not
had time to get to them all. 2.0 will be coming, that is, once 1.0 is out!
