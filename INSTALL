    Karma - Installation Guide

Standard Install
    At this time, unfortunately, I haven't had a chance to build an
    install script. Partly this is because I haven't completely
    thought out how it should be installed. Eventually karma will
    include a standard perl install script.

General Instructions
    Currently, following the directions in the

    should explain to you how to get started. See the

    for more information on how to create a

    read-only user

    for karma in your database, to

    edit the karma.conf file

    , or to use the karmagentd to

    monitor the alertlog

    and uptime statistics on your remote database.

Using Karma with a webserver
    Yes, you can use karma with a webserver, but there isn't too
    much you need to do on the karma end of things. Basically karma
    generates a set of html pages. These by default go into
    "doc_root" in the karma software directory, but this path can be
    changed via the `-k' option to karmad when you start it. Specify
    a valid path, and it will write the files there. Be sure to move
    the existing karma documentsfrom doc_root to that location, and
    create directories named "docs","help", "images", and "info"
    there as well.

Installing Perl
    Installing perl has become *MUCH* easier over the years, so
    don't be so afraid of installing it on your own system. You can
    install it from

    source

    binaries

    Installing on linux systems (most of which come with perl
    anyway) is often as simple as:

    `$ gunzip < stable.tar.gz | tar xvf -'

    `$ cd perl5.005_03'`$ ./configure'

    `$ make'and as root`$ make install'

Installing DBI
    It's pretty straightforward on most machines where Perl is
    already installed. Download the latest DBD-Oracle from your
    favorite

    CPAN Site

    , then follow these steps:

    `$ gunzip < DBI-1.13.tar.gz | tar xvf -'

    `$ cd DBI-1.13'`$ perl Makefile.PL'

    `$ make'`$ make test'then as root:

    `$ make install'

Installing DBD-Oracle
    It's pretty straightforward on most machines where Perl is
    already installed. Download the latest DBD-Oracle from your
    favorite

    CPAN Site

    , set your environment variables ORACLE_HOME, ORACLE_SID, be
    sure $ORACLE_HOME/bin is in your path, and that $ORACLE_HOME/lib
    is in your library path then followthese steps:

    `$ gunzip < DBD-Oracle-1.03.tar.gz | tar xvf -'

    `$ cd DBD-Oracle-1.03'

    `$ perl Makefile.PL'

    `$ make'

    `$ make test'

    then as root:

    `$ make install'

Installing Oracle
    Of course, none of this would be complete without an Oracle
    database to connect to. Installing Oracle, however, is really
    beyond the scope of this document. You can find useful
    documentation at

    technet

    though you'll need to register first. It's free. In addition,
    you can find

    linux specific installation instructions here.
