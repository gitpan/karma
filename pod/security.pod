=head1 Introduction

Karma has been designed with security in mind, from both the OS
perspective and the database perspective.  If you find any
security related problems or bugs, please be sure to email
them to me.

=head1 Database Security

I've created associated scripts in the "sql" directory to provide
a way to easily create a user for running karma.  Notice that
the user is created with "SELECT ANY TABLE" privilages.  This will
prevent karma from being able to modify anything in your database.
Though it does not make any such attempt, this provides peace of
mind.  

=head1 OS Level Security

Karma does not run as a cgi script, and things are done that way
for a number of reasons.  For one, it protects the database from
many iterations of a cgi script which could potentially impact
performance.  For another it virtually eliminates cgi-bin related
security issues.  The html pages which are ultimately loaded into
a browser are prebuilt, and static for each iteration until karma
wakes up again, and refreshes them.
