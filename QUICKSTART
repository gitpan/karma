Quickstart Guide:
-----------------

1. Edit the doc_root/karma.conf file
2. Make sure your database is running, and issue this command:

   $ perl karmad &

3. Open the file doc_root/index.html with a browser (you don't
   necessarily need a webserver at all).

---
If it isn't obvious already, you have to have Oracle, DBI, and DBD-Oracle
installed for everything to work.
