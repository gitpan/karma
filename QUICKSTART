NAME
    Karma - Quickstart Guide

DESCRIPTION
    You can get started quickly and easily with karma by following
    these directions.

Details
    o Edit the karma.conf file
    o Make sure your database is running, and from the karma
      directory issue this command:
        `$ bin/karmactl -s'

    o Open the file doc_root/index.html with a browser
      (you don't necessarily need a webserver at all).
    If it isn't obvious already, you have to have Oracle, DBI, DBD-
    Oracle and Perl installed for everything to work. You'll also
    need Mail::Send which comes with the MailTools module.
